## Opinion
I find this article quite interesting because it shows how the pandemic has influenced software developers. The lack of in-person meetings have affected the efficiency of even IT companies. The article explains how there was an initial decrease in programming quantity and efficiency because developers had to transition to working at home by developing their at-home setup and adapting to other circumstances. Overall, this article was interesting because it gave a general view of how the pandemic influence software developers.
